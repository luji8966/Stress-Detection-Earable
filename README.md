# Stress-Detection-Earable
Work-related stress has become a constant part of modern life, affecting both physical and mental well-being. Traditional methods of measuring stress indicators, such as heart rate (HR), often rely on large, invasive devices, which is impractical for daily use and can be expensive. This study explored the feasibility and effectiveness of using a digital otoscop to measure heart rate as a stress indicator using low-cost remote photoplethysmography (rPPG) technology. In this study, 13 participants were recruited to conduct the Trier Social Stress Test (TSST) for mild stress induction. Heart rate data were collected before, during, and after the TSST using a digital otoscope (earable device) and a Polar heart rate strap (for ground truth). The results demonstrate that the earable device performs well in detecting HR when individuals are in a rest state. However discrepancies arise when HR goes beyond the detection range or when the device position get changed in state such as speech. Overall, this study confirms the potential of using earable devices for stress detection, highlighting their promise as a non-intrusive monitoring tool. However, further research is needed to address the limitations identified and enhance the deviceâ€™s accuracy and reliability in various real-life scenarios.
